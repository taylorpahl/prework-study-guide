## Usage

This study guide contains brief descriptions of each topic that was covered in the prework course. It can be used as a reference when coding in HTML, CSS, and Javascript. It can also be a helpful tool when using Git to store code in a repository. If the DevTools console is opened, the topics that were taught in prework will be listed and Javascript code will randomly pick one topic for the user to study.
